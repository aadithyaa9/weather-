## Description
This Weather App provides users with real-time weather information, including temperature, conditions, and detailed descriptions of the weather for any location. Utilizing the Visual Crossing Weather API, the app delivers accurate forecasts, and with the Giphy API, it generates dynamic icons and GIFs that correspond to the current weather conditions.


This also makes use of babel loader for backwards compatibility and webpack for bundling files.
